					<h3>(Not) Being Present</h3>
					<p>What's the point of meeting a friend or traveling if you're not present?</p>
					<p>That's the exact same question I asked myself while traveling New Zealand. I have been to some of the most amazing places in the world with wonderful people and still would worry about what other people may think of me. I would spend so much time worrying and daydreaming about things when instead I could simply enjoy the moment, the places and the people.</p>
					<p>We have the possibility to enjoy our lives fully by living in the present. Or instead keep worrying about what might possibly happen.</p>
					<p>What do you choose?</p>

					<h3>What are you grateful for?</h3>
					<p>I am grateful for my family and their love and support. Without them I wouldn't be the person I am. Thank you!</p>
					<p>I am grateful for my amazing friends who are always there when I need them and are just fun to be around. I am blown away by them. Thank you!!</p>
					<p>I am grateful to know that I am the way I am and willing to accept myself completely.</p>
					<p>What are you grateful for?</p>

					<h3>Liked by everyone</h3>
					<p>Do you sometimes feel like you need to be liked by everyone? And try to hide your weaknesses and mistakes?</p>
					<p>Well, I did. For a long time. Sometimes, I still do because I fear getting rejected.</p>
					<p>But what's the point?!</p>
					<p>It just keeps us from making deep connections - even with the people that accept us the way we are.</p>
					<p>More importantly, it keeps us from accepting ourselves and living the life we always wanted to live.</p>
					<p>So, be who you are. Accept yourself. And start living a life for yourself and not for anyone else!</p>

					<h3>Appreciation and ...</h3>
					<p>Appreciating other people is a wonderful as well as rewarding thing to do - both for the one receiving the appreciation and the one giving it.</p>
					<p>Imagine you appreciate a friend of yours, or maybe even a stranger who is going through some troubles and anxieties.</p>
					<p>Imagine you can be the one that lifts their mood and sparks their recovey.</p>
					<p>Imagine the love you're going to receive for being so caring.</p>
					<p>You have the power to help someone and make that person's day better.</p>
					<p>So use that power of yours!</p>

					<h3>Netflix &amp; Chill</h3>
					<p>Why is watching movies and series so popular?</p>
					<p>(1) It gives people a break from their lives, their fears and everything that keeps them awake at night.</p>
					<p>It feels rewarding.</p>
					<p>But as soon as the movie ends, we solowly feel our own thoughts coming back.</p>
					<p>(2) It gives people what they crave.</p>
					<p>If you crave more love and romance, there are tons of movies and series out there for you.</p>
					<p>If you crave adventure, the movie industry got your back covered as well.</p>
					<p>So, why don't you think about your motives the next time you're about to watch a movie.</p>
					<p>This is one important step towards finding out about yourself and becoming more self-aware.</p>

					<p>Why haven't you done it?</p>
